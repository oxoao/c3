# Versions
The original and remastered versions are (so far) almost identical for speedruns. The remaster fixes some minor bugs and adds enhancements like 60fps grass, but none of the known speedtech is fixed. Original version is now delisted from Steam/EA app due to publisher request (they surely want to promote remaster and not maintain the original version, and the remaster also fixes problems on newer hardware/windows). You can otherwise still obtain the original version ([here](https://pastebin.com/kF8Uh54r)).

Original Crysis 3 was made for Windows 8 and older. For fps drops/low GPU/CPU usage: Try disabling fullscreen optimisations, and steps [here](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Crysis_3#Frame_rate_capped_at_100_or_64_FPS.2C_even_with_V-Sync_disabled).

## Known remaster changes:
### Superficial
* Fov menu option (and `cl_fov` now changes both sprint and stationary fov)
* New optional graphics settings (ray traced reflections)
* Higher minimum graphics settings (texture res option for only high or very high, lod higher even on low)
* Brightness/`r_gamma` option affects game only (no longer changes windows brightness)
* Grass (and potentially other entities?) run at higher animation rate
* Loading cutscenes no longer immediately show a prompt to skip them (makes retiming potentially harder)
* Changes to console commands available and console locked by default (use `con_restricted 0`)
* Origin/EA drm removed (now steam drm)
* Newly accessible console commands (e.g. god mode, infinite ammo, cannot be used for runs. be careful when using console commands as they may persist on save profile even after restart)
* Slower loads
* All languages are accessible by default (original version typically installs 1 localization based on region and does not allow changing, though these can be added manually. crack version has all localizations)
* Hacking keybind not changing properly bug re-introduced?
### Gameplay changes
* Extra object detail in some places (m1 pipe oob, m3 nexus area) due to the higher minimum lod (same as playing on high or very high object detail on original. does not currently lose any time)
* New menu options for reload checkpoint and restart level (seems superficial but may have unknown benefit)
* Seemingly tweaked enemy ai/stats? (alpha ceph 1st cycle no longer works with 1 electric arrow?)
* Intro cutscene changes (start of m5 loads immediately without waiting for text, possibly due to bugfixes with intro cutscenes. bug of shooting/performing other actions during cutscenes is fixed)
* M5 dialogue/trigger to activate ramp at the end is a few seconds faster (possibly due to a softlock fix, only affects glitchless)
* Bug fix where items would not be held in hands properly when loading a save holding an item

All mechanics and speedrun tech seem otherwise unchanged, and overall the changes are minor. Various performance related problems are fixed for newer hardware and windows versions.
